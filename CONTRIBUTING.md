# Contributing

We :heart: pull requests and we're always working to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute.

If you want to contribute but don't know on where you can help, check the [issues](https://github.com/ChatBootAI/chatbootai-samples/issues) and look for ones with the `PR-welcome` label.

We prefer small pull requests with minimal code changes. The smaller they are the easier they are to review and merge.
A team member will pick up your PR and review it as soon as they can. They may ask for changes or reject your pull request. This is not a reflection of you as an engineer or a person. Please accept feedback graciously as we will also try to be sensitive when providing it.

Although we generally accept many PRs they can be rejected for many reasons. We will be as transparent as possible but it may simply be that you do not have the same context or information regarding the roadmap that the core team members have. We value the time you take to put together any contributions so we pledge to always be respectful of that time and will try to be as open as possible so that you don't waste it. :smile:

**All PRs should be accompanied with tests and pass the linting rules when applicable.**
